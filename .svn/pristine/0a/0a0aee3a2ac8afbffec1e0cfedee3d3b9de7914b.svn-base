  <p> Dear NAEYC Conference Participants,</p><br>

   <p>Last week, you received a letter from Amy O’Leary, NAEYC’s President, and Rhian Evans Allvin, NAEYC’s CEO, 
    about the importance of advancing equity in early childhood education by celebrating positive investments for 
    children, families and educators while also clearly opposing discriminatory policy actions that may cause harm 
    to some of those same individuals.</p><br>
    
    <p>With our Annual Conference here in Tennessee, we are using the power of our collective voice to reach out to 
      Governor Lee and the General Assembly with two requests, which you can read more about in the petition below. 
      To learn more about the legislation we reference, you can:</p>

   <p>Dear Governor Lee and Members of the Tennessee General Assembly:</p><br>
    
   <p>We, the undersigned individuals, are members of the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), 
     here with nearly 10,000 of our fellow early childhood educators, advocates, and allies for our Annual Conference—which 
     is being held in Nashville, Tennessee for the first time in the organization’s history! We are delighted to be here, as 
     evidenced by the fact that those of us coming from afar have filled up room blocks in 21 of Nashville’s hotels, joining 
     the 20% of attendees who live right here in Tennessee.</p><br>
    
   <p>NAEYC’s vision is that all young children thrive and learn in a society dedicated to ensuring they reach their full 
     potential. The organization’s numerous position statements and publications are clear about this vision and the 
     recommendations for achieving it. Most recently, NAEYC released a groundbreaking position statement, Advancing Equity 
     in Early Childhood Education, which asserts that “all children have the right to equitable learning opportunities that 
     help them achieve their full potential as engaged learners and valued members of society.”</p> <br>
    
    <p>As members of NAEYC, we consider it our collective and professional responsibility to help address bias where and when 
      we see it, in ourselves and others, as well as in the systems and structures around us. We bring this perspective to our 
      work with children and families each and every day, celebrating positive investments for children, families and educators 
      in our communities, states, and at the federal level, while also clearly stating our opposition to discriminatory policy 
      actions at each of those levels that are harming some of the same children and families.</p><br>
    
    <p>As such, while we are here in Tennessee, we want to strongly applaud, elevate, and celebrate the state’s investments in 
      early childhood and higher education, and at the same time, ensure that we communicate our clear stance against several 
      of the actions you have undertaken in the last year.</p><br>
    
    <p>Specifically, we share deep concerns about six bills considered by the General Assembly in the last session, which could 
      have provided a license to practice discrimination against LGBTQ members of our communities in schools and child welfare 
      services. While we understand only one bill ultimately passed and was signed by Governor Lee, we encourage you to embrace 
      all the children and families in your state by not advancing similar bills in the next session.</p><br>
     
    <p>We also hope that you will change the law requiring the Governor to proclaim July 13 as Nathan Bedford Forrest Day and 
      remove the bust of Forrest from the state Capitol. We of course understand that this Governor is not the first to sign 
      the proclamation honoring Forrest, but we believe he should be the last. In this, we are proud to stand with a large, 
      bipartisan, and outspoken group of organizations and individuals who believe that Forrest does not represent the state’s 
      strong values, and, as Senator Alexander has done, called for the state to honor only those who “inspire and bring out 
      the best in all of us.”</p><br>
    
   <p>We are certainly inspired by everyone in Tennessee who has welcomed us, and who are committed to working collectively to 
     advance equity in early childhood education. We thank you for your time and consideration in support of all the children 
     and families we serve, as educators and elected officials.</p><br>
